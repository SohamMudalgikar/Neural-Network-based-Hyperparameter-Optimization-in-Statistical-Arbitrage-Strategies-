# Neural Network-based Hyperparameter Optimization in Statistical Arbitrage Strategies

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a neural network-based system that dynamically adjusts the hyperparameters of a statistical arbitrage strategy, such as mean-reversion pairs trading, to adapt to changing market conditions. It utilizes a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent within a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the strategy's parameters.

## Motivation

- Market conditions are non-stationary, and static hyperparameters can lead to suboptimal performance.
- Utilizing reinforcement learning to adjust hyperparameters can improve strategy adaptability.
